# Project Proposal Similarity Detection System

## Overview

This project is designed to identify and prevent duplicate project proposals submitted by students. By analyzing the titles and abstracts of new project submissions, the system compares them against previously submitted projects. If the similarity score exceeds a predefined threshold, the proposal is automatically rejected to avoid redundancy.

## Features

- **Project Submission**: Students can submit their project ideas, including titles and abstracts.
- **Similarity Detection**: The system compares new submissions with existing projects to identify potential duplicates.
- **Automatic Rejection**: Proposals with high similarity to existing projects are automatically rejected based on a set threshold.
- **Future Scope**: Potential extensions include adapting this system for patent application processes to enhance efficiency.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the project will be provided in future updates.

## Usage

Basic usage instructions will be added as development progresses. Initially, the system will focus on comparing and rejecting duplicate project proposals.

## Development

As development continues, detailed documentation will be added, including setup instructions, API details, and usage examples.
